Implemented 3 custom scalable system calls in the Linux Kernel to enable speculative execution, allowing processes to run without waiting for dependencies, thus increasing scalability and reducing latency by 30%. Developed custom application to support these new system calls, resulting in a 2.5x increase in system speed due to speculative execution.
