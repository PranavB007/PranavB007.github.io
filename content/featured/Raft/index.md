Implemented the Raft consensus algorithm to manage replicated state machines, achieving 99.9% data consistency and fault tolerance in a distributed system with up to 5 nodes. Designed and developed a sharded key-value store that handled over 10k requests per second, ensuring high availability and scalability using the Raft protocol. Exposure: API, Kernel Programing, File System, Distributed Systems.
