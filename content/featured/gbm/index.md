Implemented GBM- based Monte Carlo simulation for predicting stock prices, pseudo market index consisting of 5 stocks, capturing both the average directional movement and the volatility inherent in stock price movements. Statistical Analysis presented a 95% confidence interval for the model. Exposure: Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Monte Carlo Simulation,Statistics, Statistical Analysis.
