Implemented and compared multiple Neural Networks(including CNN, AlexNet, ResNet, VGG16, VGG19 and InceptionV3) to detect 14 Crop diseases on a **PlantVillage Dataset** of 30k images. AlexNet excelled with a 99.2% accuracy. Proposed approach employed a combination of NN models to detect 14 diseases with 98% accuracy for 24 disease classes.
