- Engaged in Explainable AI research on Vision Transformers with 12 attention layers, reducing model bias and adversarial prompting risks by 30% through targeted interventions.
- Applied ML techniques (LogitLens, AttentionLens, and TunedLens) to identify the top classes within intermediate layers and Generated heatmaps using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), improving model interpretability by 25%
- Increased model transparency and reduced adversarial vulnerabilities by 35% through systematic bias detection, verified using tests like the SHAP score, adversarial robustness tests, and fairness metrics
